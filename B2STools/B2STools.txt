- directb2sReelSoundsONOFF.cmd

Older pinball machines used reels to display scores on the screen. B2S Server has built-in sounds for the reel movements. Some table authors do not like these sounds and want to control them from the table instead.

The script directb2sReelSoundsONOFF.cmd will disable the sounds played by the server by telling the server that the sounds do not exist.
What it technically does is add some "Sound1-6" attributes to the Score tags in the directb2s file:

<Score Parent="Backglass" ID="1" B2SStartDigit="0" Digits="5" Spacing="100"  Sound1="" Sound2="" Sound3="" />

This will tell the B2S Server to keep quiet for these reels.

- B2SRandom.cmd

B2SRandom can be used to randomize different backglasses before starting Visual Pinball

To activate it, add the following line in the Popper Launch script

CALL C:\vPinball\B2SServer\B2STools\B2SRandom.cmd "[GAMEFULLNAME]"

or you can activate it in VPinballX.starter, see https://vpuniverse.com/forums/topic/10374-vpinballxstarter-a-little-gem-of-a-tool/

If you start a table "table.vpx" in the folder "D:\vPinball\VisualPinball\Tables\" it will try to find
D:\vPinball\VisualPinball\Tables\table-#.directb2s where # is a random number.
If it is found, the file D:\vPinball\VisualPinball\Tables\table-#.directb2s is copied over D:\vPinball\VisualPinball\Tables\table.directb2s

- DmdDeviceIniScale.cmd

When you change your Backglass screen or you change the screen scaling the DmdDevice.ini still use the coordinates from 
your earlier setup. DmdDeviceIniScale.cmd can recalculate the coordinates (position and size) of the DMD settings.
You can "drop" a DmdDevice.ini file on the DmdDeviceIniScale.cmd, it asks for some parameters and it will make a copy of
the file and then modify the original to your new settings.
