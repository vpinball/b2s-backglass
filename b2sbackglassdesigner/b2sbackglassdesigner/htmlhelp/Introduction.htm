<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts9">Welcome to the 'B2S Backglass Designer'.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts8"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">'Real pinball' and 'Virtual pinball' is a wonderful hobby. Get away from all the stress and madness of life, dive into the playing and/or creating of great pinball tables and/or backglasses.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">'B2S' was started by Roger Svensson in 2011. It was never intended to be as big as it has become. Roger was updating a first couple of EM tables that he made in VP and thought it would be nice if the score reels could be displayed on a second screen. He spent a long night with (in his words) 'lots of beer' and came up with that first version of B2S where the table could send data to another program by setting colored areas on the screen.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This solution turned out too unreliable, it was working okay on some PCs but made the table stutter on other PCs.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">After another late night he had the second version, that is still being used, ready. This time it was working really well on most PCs and people was starting to request more and more tables with B2S backglasses. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The development of the B2S system is taken over by Herweh (that's me). I'm trying to take it to the next level and make it accessible for non-programmers.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The basic idea behind B2S always was: Use a background image, cut out some parts of this image, create an illumination on these image parts, lay these image parts over the background image and show or hide them. This gives a perfect illusion of switching on or off some bulbs behind the background image.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Programming this 'B2S Backglass Designer' is my way to say ' thanks a lot' to the virtual pinball community.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
