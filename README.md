## B2S.Backglass Server

### Installation:

- Unzip all files into a folder under your VisualPinball\B2SServer folder and overwrite already existing files with this new ones.
  **It doesn't have to be installed in the tables folder! A better example would be C:\vPinball\VisualPinball\B2SServer.**
- Right click the `B2SBackglassServer.dll` and click on `Properties`. Maybe you'll find the following text on the `General` tab:
  `This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer`. Click on the `Unblock` button.
  Everything is fine when you are not able to find this text.
- Start the `B2SBackglassServerRegisterApp.exe` in the folder and the server dll should be registered.
  **IMPORTANT**: With Win7 (and above) start the .exe as administrator. 
  Old installations can be cleaned up using [Nirsoft's RegDllView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/registered_dll_view.html)
- On older windows machines, check the color depth of the backglass monitor. It has to be 32bit.
- Also on older windows versions, the B2S backglass server requires .NET Framework 4 to be installed on your computer. It can be downloaded [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=0a391abd-25c1-4fc0-919f-b21f31ab88b7&displaylang=en).

- You're ready to download and play some `directB2S` backglasses.

### Backglass settings:

You can set, tweak and save a lot settings for each backglass. **Most of the features only work when run in `EXE` mode**
To get into this settings screen, please click the backglass with the mouse and press `S` on your keyboard. A dialog window opens.

In this settings dialog you're able to:

- Hide or show the VPinMAME DMD, the B2S DMD and/or the grill
- The setting `Bring BG` allows you to control which window comes on top. There are three states available:
   1. `Standard` setting (both FormToBack and FormToFront turned off) -> as it was in 1.3.0.6.
   2. `FormToFront` sets the flag Form.TopMost = True -> No other window can come on top of the backglass. **The DMD is not present in the taskbar when it is drawn in the backglass**
   3. `FormToBack` forces the backglass to the back and ignores any try to get them come forward -> the backglass stay in back. **The B2S Server is not available in the taskbar at all.**
- Do some performance tuning, especially with the `Skip ... frames` settings
- Do some LED settings
- Setup the screenshot settings to create screenshots from the running backglasses with the `Print` or `Print screen` key
- Do some VPinMAME data logging

### Pretty important when you're having some stutter:

- Check the color depth of the backglass monitor. It has to be 32bit.
- Check the `Start the backglass in EXE mode` check button and restart the backglass
- Tweak with the `Skip ... frames`. Maybe start with Lamps 2 or 3, Solenoids 10 and LED 2.
- Tweak with the LED type. Try to use the `Simple LEDs`.
- Don't forget to save your settings.

### ScreenRes files

The B2S Server uses [ScreenRes files](ScreenRes.txt) files. The default file name is [ScreenRes.txt](ScreenRes.txt). 
When the B2S Server loads a backglass, it tries to find TableName.res and if not found it will revert to [ScreenRes.txt](ScreenRes.txt).

The default filename can be altered by setting the registry key Software\B2S\B2SScreenResFileNameOverride

From release 1.3.1.1 comment lines starting with a "#" are supported. If you use tools not supporting comments (or old releases), you need to remove these lines.
([PinballX 5.55](https://forums.gameex.com/forums/topic/28239-news-pinballx-555/#comment-209692) has been updated for example.)

### B2S_ScreenResIdentifier

The `B2S_ScreenResIdentifier.exe` tool included in the package will help you alter your *.res files.
You can even "throw" one of the res files on the execuatable and it will edit it for you (the first parameter when started on a command line is the filename to a res file).
