When you select a tablename.vpx file, press right mouse and select `B2S Server copy Screenres template` 

	-> each *.res file present in this folder will be available in the menu. The file.res file selected will be copied to tablename.res next to your tablename.vpx file.

**You will have to add your own res files of preference to this folder**
